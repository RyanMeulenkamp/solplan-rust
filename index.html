<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>
    This is a wasm demo build of <a href="https://github.com/RyanMeulenkamp/solplan-rust">Solplan</a>, a
    little application that I wrote to layout solar panels on a roof. This was more of a Rust practise then
    an actual usable application.
</p>

<p>
    It is garbage-in = garbage-out. The input data is just there for convenience/as a placeholder.
    If you actually want to use the application, please check the inputs for yourself, especially
    the panel types.
